    <p>In this photomontage, I also used four images like the first photomontage. However, the difference is that I used masking and blending modes for three images instead of two. For the hand holding the phone, I used "Linear Burn", "Texture" with it being grass, and "Satin" to create a static dark hand holding a phone that reflects the background of the night sky. For the hand framing, I used "Luminosity", "Bevel & Emboss" with "Contour", "Inner Glow", "Outer Glow", and "Drop Shadow" to create pale, white hands in the phone screen. Lastly, for the eye I used "Hard Mix" and "Inner Glow" to make an pretty creepy eye that replaces the moon in the background. Overall, it represents the social problem of pictures distorting the perspectives of viewers, which was inspired by the first reading, "In Plato's Cave" from Susan Sontag's "On Photography".</p>
