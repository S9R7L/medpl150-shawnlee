    <p>This photomontage uses four images (including the background) and it is supposed to represent climate change, an ecological issue we have today. Here, only the flammable sign and the flame have masking and blending modes for them. As for what blending mode was used, it was "Hard Light" for both of them. I wanted to make the fire and the flammable sign to combine with each other while having this sort of intensity and it came out well. I also decided to throw in a few things like "Outer Glow" or "Drop Shadow" to help with the merging of the two images.</p>
