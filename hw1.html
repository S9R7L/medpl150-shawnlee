	<h2>Creative Statement</h2>
	<p>My work here mainly demonstrates the basic, introductory-level concepts of HTML. As a new student exploring the world of web designing, I aim to learn much of its magic so that I can create something I can feel very satisfied with. In order for me to achieve that, I will utilize the resources within the media to the best of my abilities.</p>

	<h2>What this is</h2>
	<p>A simple page put together using HTML</p>

	<h2>Why this is</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>To learn HTML</li>
		<li>To show off
		<ol>
			<li>To my boss</li>
			<li>To my friends</li>
			<li>To my cat</li>
			<li>To the little talking duck in my brain</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
