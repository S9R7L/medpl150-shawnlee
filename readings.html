	<h2>Reflection on "In Plato's Cave" by Susan Sontag</h2>
 	<p>When I read the first chapter, "In Plato's Cave", of Susan Sontag's book, "On Photography", it felt eye-opening when I came to understand the main points she wanted to express in her book. She references Plato's "Allegory of the Cave", where prisoners in a cave mistake shadows on a wall for reality, and applies it to modern society. We live in a world where photographs make up what we perceive as reality when it is, in fact, not reality. I found it surprising to know that the people of today, the "prisoners", are treating photographic images, the "shadows", as the real thing, more so when I realize that I am also one of those many "prisoners".</p>

	<p>As someone who grew up in the digital age, surrounded by smartphones and social media, I have taken photographs for granted. In times where I take photos with my camera, Sontag has made me realize that I have never attached any real meaning to them. I simply take the photo and move on, which might mean that I have been taking photos for the sake of taking them. As Sontag states, "photography is not practiced by most people as an art. It is mainly a social rite, a defense against anxiety, and a tool of power." (page 8)</p>

	<p>Another thing I have come to learn about is how photographers are capable of manipulating the photos they take. They can be altered so that the context will seem completely different from what it originally once was. For example, an "ugly or grotesque subject may be moving because it has been dignified by the attention of the photographer." (page 15) While I did know that it was possible to edit photographs, these photos, as previously stated, are what viewers may end up seeing as the real world. As much as I did not want to believe it, Sontag knows that these images are capable of influencing people. That is why Sontag wants photographers to keep that in mind so that they will have some sense of responsibility when working with photographic images.</p>  

	<p>The last and, in my opinion, the most disturbing point Sontag makes is how photographs can dull our emotions. To be more exact, it dulls how we respond to the images. I know this is true because I remember feeling a great sense of detachment in my past when looking at photographs, particularly during history classes when they show multiple images of tragedies such as war or genocide. "The quality of feeling, including moral outrage, that people can muster in response to photographs...also depends on the familiarity with these images." (page 19) In other words, repeated exposure to photographic images can result in being too familiar with them, as well as the fact that viewers might treat those very images as reality.</p>

	<p>Overall, this chapter has helped me see that, within the world of photography, it is not as innocent as I perceived it to be. While I found it to be unexpected and even unpleasant at times, what I learned are the truths in photography. They are truths that have changed my thoughts not just on photography, but on how I see the world itself.</p>
