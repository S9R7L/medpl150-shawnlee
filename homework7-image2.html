    <h1>Homework 7 Image 2</h1>

    <img src="homework7-imageoriginal.jpg" alt="Homework 7 Image 2" width="600">

    <p>I chose this image because I felt it was perfect for what I had in mind for this assignment. I tranformed it by tracing the entire city in the image first and copied and pasted the overall trace again to flip that upside down. After that, I put a hexagon in the middle as well as a line and then used the triad colors for each respective part.</p>
