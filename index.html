	<p>My work here mainly demonstrates the basic, introductory-level concepts of HTML. As a new student exploring the world of web designing, I aim to learn much of its magic so that I can create something I can feel very satisfied with. In order for me to achieve that, I will utilize the resources within the media to the best of my abilities.</p>
