Based on the example index.html from the WikiHow tutorial (code above):

Add MEDPL 150, your section number, and your name to the Document <title>, following this structure: "MEDPL 150 Section 1 - Celeste Newcomb"

Replace the <h1> title with your name.

Replace the <h2> title with "Homeworks"

Replace Jelly, bread and butter with Homework #1, Homework #2 and Homework #3.

Replace the instructions inside <p> tags with a Creative Statement (1 paragraph) about yourself and what informs your work or research. Make sure to add which tools are you familiar with (now you can add Photoshop, Illustrator, and HTML to the list!)
