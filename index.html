	<h2>Creative Statement</h2>
	<p>My work here mainly demonstrates the basic, introductory-level concepts of HTML on a newly created web page. These concepts include tags, elements, page titles, paragraphs, headings, lists, links, and images. In the beginning, I was unsure if I could accomplish anything in web designing, let alone HTML, since it was so new and unfamiliar to me. However, by utilizing the HTML Dog tutorial site, it was possible for me to put together this entire web page more easily than I initially expected. Moving forward, I aim to continue growing so that I can create something I can feel completely satisfied with.</p>

	<h2>What this is</h2>
	<p>A simple page put together using HTML</p>

	<h2>Why this is</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>To learn HTML</li>
		<li>To show off
		<ol>
			<li>To my boss</li>
			<li>To my friends</li>
			<li>To my cat</li>
			<li>To the little talking duck in my brain</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Because I've fallen in love with my computer and want to give her some HTML loving</li>
	</ul>
