    <h1>Homework 5 Image</h1>

    <img src="homework5.jpg" alt="Homework 5" width="600">

    <p>Creating this pattern started with a single line. Using the Transform Effect, I got 6 copies of the same line at a 60 degree angle which resulted in this cool pattern that formed a polyagon. To add a little more, I added a second polygon in the middle of the first and made it 1 px thicker as well as making it red. To me, it looks like a camera of sorts and creating the pattern with it was just a bunch of them staring at me. To create that pattern, I simply copied my final creation from Adobe Illustrator and pasted it multiple times in Adobe Photoshop, where I adjusted the size and positions of the image.</p>
