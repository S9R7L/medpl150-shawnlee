    <p>I drew an eye which should represent sadness. I made it seem kind of like a cloud that rains, except it has tears flowing. I used mostly blue colors for the majority of the picture, which include the background, the iris, the "cloud", and the tears. I hoped it would emphasize the sad feeling more since blue is associated with feelings of sadness. One small detail would be the dashed line scribbles I drew as the eyebrow. </p>
