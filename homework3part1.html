  <p>Shallow Depth of Field:</p>

  <p>In this image, there was a pigeon in the background where I felt I had to take the picture before it flew off. Combined with the post-it with a drawing on the window, I thought it would be perfect to demonstrate the shallow depth of view.

  <p>Deep Depth of Field:</p>

  <p>I decided to take a photo of a hallway, and what I liked about this particular hallway was the pipes at the ceiling. I think it helps to really show that deep depth of view.</p>
  
  <p>Photoshopped Field Blur:</p>
  <img src="homework3-image3.jpg" alt="Homework 3 Image 3" width="600">
  <p>This is a door that leads to a roof balcony, or so I assume. In any case, it is inaccessible to the public but there are no rules for taking pictures so that I did. I used the smudge tool to blur out the lower half of the notice and, with the field blur, I made the background even more blurrier.</p>
